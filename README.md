# Pong Game

This repository contains a Python script that implements the classic Pong game using the Tkinter library. The script was created by myself, [Wil K Edwards](https://github.com/EdwardsWK), as a personal project.

## How to Run

To run the Pong game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the Python file (`pong_game.py`) in a text editor or Python IDE.
4. Save the file.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
6. Run the command `python pong_game.py`.
7. The game window will open, and you can start playing Pong.

## Gameplay

- Use the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle's movement.
- The goal is to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom edge of the window.
- Each time the ball hits the paddle, your score will increase.
- The game ends when the ball hits the bottom edge of the window.
